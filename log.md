# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on the AI for [FCC Tic Tac Toe.]( https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game)


**Thoughts:** Felt like bashing my head into a wall...but in a good way. I feel I am using way too much code to accomplish this task. I need to clean up quite a bit of spaghetti code once I finish.

**Link to work:** Coming Soon!
