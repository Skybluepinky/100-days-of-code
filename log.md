# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on the initial Front End Developer Courses from FreeCodeCamp


**Thoughts:** I feel good about this, I know it will be a challenge to get myself to work on this for an hour after long days at work during the busy season, but I do want this. I've wanted this for a long time and now it is time for me to really put my wants into actions.

**Today's Progress**: Set up and started my wife's blog site built on nodeJS

### Day 6: January 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on Tic Tac Toe AI 


**Thoughts:** I did more staring at the screen than coding. To figure out how to get the game to win without a bunch of if or switch statments
