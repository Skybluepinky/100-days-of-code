# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on the initial Front End Developer Courses from FreeCodeCamp


**Thoughts:** I feel good about this, I know it will be a challenge to get myself to work on this for an hour after long days at work during the busy season, but I do want this. I've wanted this for a long time and now it is time for me to really put my wants into actions.

### Day 2: January 11, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Alright, Day 2! Learned to request user input and some HTML/CSS styling.ðŸ˜ƒ #100DaysOfCode #FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I feel like I am speeding through. Makse sense as much of this stuff are things I have touched on at LaunchCode etc. The coolest thing I learned was how to collect user input directly from HTML. Seems much simpler than I imagined. It has me excited to move on.

### Day 6: January 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on Tic Tac Toe AI 


**Thoughts:** I did more staring at the screen than coding. To figure out how to get the game to win without a bunch of if or switch statments
